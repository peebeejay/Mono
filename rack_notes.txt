1. Use req.path to get the url path.


2. A Route object knows:
  - What path to match '/users/:id'
  - Which Route matches the requested path
  - Once found, instantiate the Route's controller
  - Run the appropriate method

3. What a Router Class should do
  - Given a Rack::Request object, understand which Route matches
    the requested path.
  - Once found, instantiate the Route's controller and run the
    appropriate method.
